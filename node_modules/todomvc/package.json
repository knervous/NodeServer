In addition, we have a core project team composed of:\r\n\r\n#### [Addy Osmani](http://github.com/addyosmani) - Founder/Lead\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96270e4c3e5e9806cf7245475c00b275.png?s=40\">\r\n  Addy is a Software Engineer at Google who originally created TodoMVC. He oversees the project direction, maintenance and organizes the planning and development efforts of the team.\r\n\r\n#### [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) - Lead Developer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d36a92237c75c5337c17b60d90686bf9.png?s=40\">\r\nSindre is a Web Developer who leads core development, quality control and application design for the project. His engineering contributions have helped us ensure consistency and best practices are enforced wherever possible. Sindre also leads up development of the TodoMVC application spec.\r\n\r\n#### [Pascal Hartig](https://github.com/passy) - Developer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be451fcdbf0e5ff07f23ed16cb5c90a3.png?s=40\">\r\nPascal is a Software Engineer at Twitter with a deep passion for consistency. He watches pull requests and helps developers getting their contributions integrated with TodoMVC.\r\n\r\n#### [Stephen Sawchuk](https://github.com/stephenplusplus) - Developer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/723048?v=2&s=40\">\r\nStephen is a Front-end Engineer at Quicken Loans that cares about improving the maintainability and developer experience of open-source projects. His recent contributions include helping us move all apps over to using Bower and implementing the new information bar.\r\n\r\n#### [Colin Eberhardt](https://github.com/colineberhardt) - Developer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73bba00b41ff1c9ecc3ee29487bace7d?s=40\">\r\nColin is a software consultant at Scott Logic who is passionate about all software - from JavaScript to Java, and C# to Objective-C. His recent contribution to the project has been a fully automated test suite.\r\n\r\n#### [Sam Saccone](https://github.com/samccone) - Developer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/602125/f2f1d93164ec62b527f0398c65b2d1f3.jpg?size=40\">\r\nSam is a Software Engineer at Google who is driven by an endless desire to create, solve problems, and improve developers' lives.\r\n\r\n#### [Arthur Verschaeve](https://github.com/arthurvr) - Developer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"https://en.gravatar.com/avatar/e34daab0d2e344219adb5234198269c5?size=40\">\r\nArthur is an open-source fanboy from Belgium. He is passionate about developer tooling and all things JavaScript.\r\n\r\n#### [Gianni Chiappetta](https://github.com/gf3) - Logo designer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b0209ae3652cc5a7d53545e759fbe39.png?s=40\">\r\nGianni is a programmer and designer currently working as the Chief Rigger at MetaLab.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"230\" height=\"230\" src=\"media/icon-small.png\">\r\n\r\nTodoMVC has been called many things including the 'Speed-dating' and 'Rosetta Stone' of MV\\* frameworks. Whilst we hope that this project is able to offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of what a framework may be capable of.\r\n\r\nIt is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.\r\n\r\nAlso, please keep in mind that TodoMVC is not the perfect way to compare the size of different frameworks. We intentionally use the unminified versions to make reading the source code easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Involved\r\n\r\nWhilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.\r\n\r\nCheck out our [contribution docs](contributing.md) for more info.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nEverything in this repo is MIT License unless otherwise specified.\r\n\r\nMIT Â© Addy Osmani, Sindre Sorhus, Pascal Hartig, Stephen Sawchuk.\r\n",
